            <p>My name is Merari M. Gonzalez, I'm originally from B.C. Mexico, and have been residing in Utah EU since I was 13. 
                I'm a licensed Barber, and a Softwore Development Student. I'm a mom of 3 boys named Kingston, Gavin and Maddox, who often challenge me to become a better person than I was before. 
                I'm so very grateful for all the blessings that I have in my life, and that too challenges me to be a better human being.
