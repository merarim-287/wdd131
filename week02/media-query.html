            <h2>Book of Mormon | Mosiah 4:1</h2>
            <p>And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him
            by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth,
            for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.</p>

            <p>And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be
            patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an
            instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.</p>
